\section{Introduction}
The explosive growth of blockchain technology has introduced an unprecedented influx of data, creating both opportunities and challenges for traders and investors. With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), cryptocurrency trading, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchain has become a cornerstone for digital assets. However, this same expansion has overwhelmed traders with vast, unstructured data, making it difficult to extract actionable insights.
